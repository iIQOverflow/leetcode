# Q
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

## Time Complexity
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\O(n^2)).Traverse the list containing nn elements only once. Each look up in the table costs only O(1) time.
## Space Complexity
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\O(n)).The extra space required depends on the number of items stored in the hash table, which stores at most n elements.
